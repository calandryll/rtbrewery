# Red Tide Home Brewery

## Homebrewery Controller
This is a new single vessel electric brew in a bag (eBIAB) setup for my home brewery.  The PID for mash control uses the algrorithm from Justin Angevaare creator of [brew2](https://github.com/jangevaare/brew2).  The controller will be running on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Node Red and potentially InfluxDB for logging purposes.

### To Do
- Put together parts list for building the controller
- Add wiring schematic and images of controller wiring
- Add timer for mash and hop additions
- BeerXML importing for mash temperature and hop schedules
